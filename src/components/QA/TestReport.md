## Execution Instructions

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Create test users in Supabase Auth
   - Verify user profiles are created
   - Ensure proper permissions are set

2. **Test Execution**:
   - Run each test scenario 5 times (5 games total)
   - Document all issues encountered
   - Record performance metrics
   - Capture screenshots/logs for failures

3. **Reporting**:
   - Update test results in real-time
   - Categorize issues by severity
   - Provide recommendations for fixes

## Success Criteria

- **Critical**: All users can join game rooms without RLS errors
- **High**: Games complete successfully end-to-end
- **Medium**: No game-breaking bugs in 5 test games
- **Low**: Acceptable performance (< 2s response times)
